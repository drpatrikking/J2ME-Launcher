# J2ME-Launcher 🥇
A simple batch J2ME launcher with emulator and games.
## What is J2ME Launcher? 🪄
J2ME Launcher is a small project, that simplifies the process of downloading, emulating and playing J2ME games on Windows PC's. J2ME Launcher utilizes Windows command line and batch files. Just run a simple file, choose what game you want to play and enjoy! I would like J2ME Launcher to function like an archive for J2ME games and apps in the future.
## How to install? ❗
Grab the latest release from releases section, unzip it with [WinRAR](https://www.win-rar.com/start.html?&L=17), [7Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) or any other archiving utility. Then, move the whole J2MELauncher folder to your **Documents** folder. **You must do this, otherwise J2ME Launcher won't work!!** And then just run the shortcut! You can move the shortcut anywhere you want. (e.g. desktop)
## How to compile the source code? 🧩
You can't, because the source code **does not** include the emulator and games, but the release does.
## What is included with J2ME Launcher? 🎁
- The launcher itself
- KEmulator nnmod 2.15.1
- J2ME Games ready to play (currently 20 of them)
## Credits 🫶
Credits goes to creators of KEmulator and creators of [nnmod](https://nnp.nnchan.ru/kem/), this project wouldn't be real without them.
